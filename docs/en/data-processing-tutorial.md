## Data Processing Tutorial

### Load data as Table

Data in MLSQL only one format, Table. So if you have other formats eg. CSV, JSon, Parquet, ElasticSearch index,
We should load them as tables first. So you can process the table in SQL or train modular.
 
```sql
load csv.`/tmp/abc.csv` as table1;
```

here is the template:

```sql
load format.`path` as tableName;
```

Sometimes , we need to specify some options to load csv file, you can do like thisï¼š

```sql
load csv.`/tmp/abc.csv`
options header="true"
as table1;
```
