# StreamingPro

[If github is too slow to view ,please click me](http://www.jianshu.com/p/3c19f8b9341c)

StreamingPro is not a complete
application, but rather a code library and API that can easily be used
to build your streaming application which may run on Spark Streaming.

StreamingPro also make it possible that all you should do to build streaming program is assembling components(eg. SQL Component) in configuration file. 
Of source , if you are a geek who like do every thing by programing,we also encourage you use API provided
by StreamingPro which is more easy to use then original API designed by Spark/Storm.

## Features

* Pure spark streaming program (Storm/Spark in future)
* No need of coding, only declarative workflows
* SQL-Oriented workflows support  
* Data continuously streamed in & processed in near real-time
* dynamically CURD of workflows  at runtime via Rest API (in single instance or multiple instances) 
* Flexible workflows (input, output, parsers, etc...) 
* High performance
* Scalable
